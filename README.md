# This was a test to see if project started in Springboot would successfully run
# through Jenkins Pipeline with maven compile and test steps.
# It seems to complete mvn compile without problems but stalls during test.
# Seems like there is was to distribute the mvn work between executors but that is beyond me at this point.
